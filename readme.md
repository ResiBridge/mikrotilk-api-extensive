since the source is in raml, i decided to download raml and convert it to openapi and host it on git pages - https://resibridge.github.io/mikrotilk-api-extensive/

wget raml from https://tikoci.github.io/restraml/ -> oasraml-cli to convert raml to openapi -> create gh-pages branch -> swagger ui from openapi -> host on github pages

thanks to https://tikoci.github.io/restraml/
